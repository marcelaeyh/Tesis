# 🪐 ALMA Mapping of Molecular Gas and Dust in the Post-AGB Star IRAS 15445-5449

This repository contains the code, data processing scripts, and visualization tools developed for my undergraduate thesis in Astronomy at the Universidad de Antioquia.  
The project focuses on reconstructing the spatial and kinematic distribution of some molecular species in the circumstellar envelope of the post-AGB star **IRAS 15445–5449**, using data from **ALMA**.
